                <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks.
                    I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
                    Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

                    We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves
